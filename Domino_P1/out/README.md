##Handley Project #1

1. Version 1:
    - Launch game from console (DominoGame.java)
    - Player 1 (human) will be prompted to select a
      piece from the available hand or to draw from the
      boneyard.
        - Player 1 must, when prompted, enter an integer value for the piece
          he/she wishes to play, then a position indicated by L/l or R/r.
        - Invalid moves and input will result in Player 1 being
          prompted to try again.
        - Refusing to draw from the boneyard when no valid
          moves are available is considered to be a forfeit of
          the player's turn.
    - Players will alternate turn until a winner is declared.
